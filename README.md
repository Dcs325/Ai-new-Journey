Python Personalized Greeting Script ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple yet friendly Python script designed to greet users with a personalized message. It demonstrates basic Python concepts such as user input, variables, and conditional logic (if, elif, else) to create an interactive experience.

âœ¨ Features
Personalized Greetings: Asks the user for their name and incorporates it into a custom greeting.

Case-Insensitive Name Check: Recognizes special names regardless of capitalization (e.g., "Great One", "great one", "GREAT ONE" all work).

Multiple Special Greetings:

A unique welcome message for the "Great One."

A distinct greeting for a "Python Enthusiast."

Continuous Interaction (Looping): The script keeps asking for names, allowing you to greet multiple friends without restarting the program.

Graceful Exit: Users can type 'quit' at any time to politely end the interaction.
